Create a FLASK APPLICATION that allows a user to select a date range and see historyical Conversion rate for USD /CAD from XE. https://www.xe.com/currencytables/ THEIR API is expensive so I would like to scrape the data from their website, create a nice UI and allow me lets say im loking for XE RATES from December 2025 to January 2026. It would show in a easy way to copy paste into my notebook.
